# cryptobot
AI-powered, Cerebras-accelerated crypto trading at hackathon speed—coded (mostly) by AI, running at the speed of vibe!

This project is a real-time, Python-based crypto trading simulator that leverages Qwen-3 (on Cerebras) to decide when to buy, sell, or hold BTC. Instead of hard-coded rules, every decision comes from a lightning-fast LLM, with prompt-tuned logic and transparent reasoning.

🟢 Built in VS Code with Cline and prompt engineering

⚡️ Trades BTC/EUR using live Coinmotion rates

🤖 Every move explained by Qwen—see the “why” behind each decision

🎨 Colorful, hackathon-friendly terminal output

🛠️ Ready for experimentation: tweak prompts, try new assets, or plug into your own workflow

How it works
Fetches the latest BTC/EUR price every 30 seconds.

Tracks all historical prices, balances, and trading volume.

Sends context to Qwen, which replies in strict JSON (“Buy”, “Sell”, “Hold”, plus reasoning).

Makes trades and logs everything—fast, simple, and AI-driven.

Built for the Cerebras × Cline Hackathon—because sometimes the future of coding is all about the vibe.
